I am currently a professor in the area of mechatronics in the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceara.

My research interests lie at the synergistic amalgamation of electronics, mechanics, control theory and computer science. In particular, my recent research works mostly focus on robust and online system identification.
